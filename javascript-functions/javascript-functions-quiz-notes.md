## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

A tool to make code more readable and reusable.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

The function keyword, optional name, zero or more parameters, code block, optional return statement

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

The function's name, parentheses with zero or more arguments inside.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

The code block within the function is being executed when the function is called. Defining the function does not result in the code being executed.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

The parameter is the placeholder variable in the function definition whose value is unknown until the function is called and an argument is passed in the function call.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

To make code reusable by repeating a code block with different input values.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

Causes the function to produce a value and exits the function.
