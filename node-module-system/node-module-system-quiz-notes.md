## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a JavaScript module?

A single .js file. Modules can be imported/exported with different module systems. Node.JS can run CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules.

- What are the advantages of modular programming?

To break down a large problem into many smaller solutions to sub-problems.
Instead of having one large JS file have all the code, different behaviors can be separated out into different modules so that certain modules can be updated with less likelihood of messing up another module.

- In JavaScript, how do you make a function in a module available to other modules?

export {function or variable name}

- In JavaScript, how do you use a function from another module?

import {function or variable name} from "module-name"
