## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

I should be able to complete my desired features by end of Week 2. In the currently deployed version, the real-time messaging is functioning as well as user signup and signin. I am almost done with handling Friend Requests. The next important feature to work on is being able to create a conversation. Currently I can only send messages inside premade conversations. User signout should be trivial to implement. User authorization should be simple as well. If I find myself running short on time, I can make conversations only limited to private messages and not have to worry about adding a conversationName column to the database design.
