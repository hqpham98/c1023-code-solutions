## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?

Async functions allow the use of await and dictate that the function will run as an asynchronous function.
The body of an async function behaves synchronously. When it hits a line that has await for a Promise, the function pauses until the Promise is resolved and then proceeds line by line.

- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  await is the similar as Promise.then. Then handles the pass value of the Promise and can handle the reject value. await waits for the Promise to resolve and gets the pass or reject value.

- When do you use `async`?

When you want to use await.

- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)

Use await when you want to grab the fulfillment value of a Promise object without needing .then chains. You can only use await inside of an async function or at the top level of a module.

- How do you handle errors with `await`?

try and catch.

- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?

try attempts to run some lines of code. If an error occurs, no more lines of code in the try will be executed. lines of code in the catch statement will run. You can throw an error inside of a function if you want to generate a specific error.

- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?

The Promise may still be pending, so if you are trying to assign the result of a Promise to a variable and the Promise is pending, you will receive a pending Promise object.
If it rejects, the variable will equal the reject value of the Promise.

- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?
  async and await because it avoids callbacks and .then chaining.
